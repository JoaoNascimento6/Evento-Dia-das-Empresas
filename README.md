## Project Description

>The Integrated Project II academic unit aims to ideate and develop a communication plan for one of the events/projects listed in the annex. The communication plan will mandatorily include the following components:

- Graphic identity
- Website (prototyping and implementation)
- Graphic/multimedia supports for event/project communication in printed and/or digital formats (e.g., posters, social media posts, identification cards, participation certificates, brochures, animations/videos).

### Website

[Include information about the prototyping and implementation of the website, highlighting key features, technologies used, and links for prototype viewing or website access.]

Summary: Implementation of Website Components

# The implementation of the project involves three main components: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a mention of the use of React.

## HTML Implementation 
The HTML development focused on semantic structures, ensuring correctness. Information such as text, images, hyperlinks, and a brief event summary with keywords for web crawlers was included. The chosen font and icons were imported through research, aiming for inclusivity and adherence to W3C standards.

## CSS Implementation
CSS usage strictly followed the content taught in classes, with a CSS Reset at the beginning. The hamburger menu code, requested by the instructor, was adapted to fit project needs. Some properties not extensively covered in classes were researched, like vertical-align, text-shadow, box-shadow, object-fit, and others. Media queries were employed for responsiveness, adjusting content based on screen size.

## JavaScript Implementation 
JavaScript functionalities include a countdown to the event, displaying an arrow to return to the top after scrolling, and changing the color of the hamburger menu spans. The code also features a logo that appears only after scrolling past the hero image. For the mobile version, a script ensures the visibility of a hamburger menu and logo.

## React Implementation
React was integrated into the HTML to leverage its capabilities. The React code in the project is specifically used for displaying event comments, creating an array of three comments adapted from a curriculum code snippet.

The integration of these components contributes to the creation of a comprehensive and responsive website for the specified event.

# Conclusion: Learning Takeaways

Through the implementation of the project, I gained practical insights into web development, encompassing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. The process involved meticulous attention to semantic HTML structures, adherence to CSS principles with a focus on responsiveness, and the utilization of JavaScript for dynamic functionalities, such as countdowns and scroll-triggered elements.

The project highlighted the importance of research skills, especially when incorporating external elements like fonts and icons. It underscored the significance of responsive design, achieved through media queries, ensuring the adaptability of the website across various devices.

Moreover, the use of React provided a hands-on experience in creating dynamic content elements, enhancing user interactivity.

In summary, this project not only reinforced theoretical knowledge from classes but also emphasized the practical considerations and problem-solving skills essential for effective web development.
